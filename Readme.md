## Minor Project ~ B.Tech Final Year

This is a WSI Image to ICD10 Code Classifier where-in we try to implement an on-the-fly data generator which generates patches of a large WSI image and using the concept of Multi-Instance Learning we build an attention based classifier which uses MONAI ZOO's EXOANEPath Tissue Feature Extractor which basically fetches features out of patches and then these features are aggregated and trained against the ICD-10 code for the WSI Image

Further scope of project is to achieve report-generation/diagnosis prediction
